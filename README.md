# Avatar-Game
TypeScript-coded game written in Visual Studio Code w/ custom graphics

My first game

Based on the TV Show, Avatar: The Last Airbender, this game is a shooting game. The objective is to prevent enemy ships from flying past your character by shooting elemental bullets at them. The player has three lives. Over time, the enemy ships move faster to challenge the player.

Challenges with the game:
- Efficiently coding the game to minimize the amount of code that I needed to write
- Removing a bullet once it hits a target (At the moment, a bullet will keep moving until it reaches the other end of the screen, which makes the game very easy. Ideally, once a bullet hits a ship, the bullet would disappear from the screen.)
